\title{Test if the new plot matches a target (snapshot) plot}
\usage{
expect_snapshot_plot(
  current,
  label,
  width = 480,
  height = 480,
  tol = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps),
  metric = "AE",
  fuzz = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current}{an object of class \code{ggplot} or a function which returns a base R plot. See Examples below.}

\item{label}{a string to identify the snapshot (alpha-numeric, hypohens, or underscores). Each plot in the test suite must have a unique label.}

\item{width}{of snapshot in pixels}

\item{height}{of snapshot in pixels}

\item{tol}{distance estimates larger than this threshold will trigger a test failure. Scale depends on the \code{metric} argument. With the default \code{metric="AE"} (absolute error), the \code{tolerance} corresponds roughly to the number of pixels of difference between the plot and the reference image.}

\item{metric}{string with a \href{http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#metric}{metric}
from \link[magick:metric_types]{metric_types()} such as \code{"AE"} or \code{"phash"}}

\item{fuzz}{relative color distance (value between 0 and 100) to be considered similar
in the filling algorithm}
}
\value{
A \code{tinytest} object. A tinytest object is a
\code{logical} with attributes holding information about the test that was
run
}
\description{
This expectation can be used with \code{tinytest} to check if the new plot matches
a target plot.
}
\details{
When the expectation is checked for the first time, the expectation fails and
a reference plot is saved to the \verb{inst/tinytest/_tinyviztest} folder.

When the expectation fails, the reference plot, the new plot, and a diff are
saved to the \code{inst/tinytest/label} folder. Call the \code{review()} function to compare.

To update a snapshot, delete the reference file from the \verb{_tinyviztest}
folder and run the test suite again.
